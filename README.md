## How to contribute (fix bugs / add features)

1. `npm i`
1. `npm start`

### Optional Stuff

Currently, development happens by default in Firefox. If you would like Firefox to remember any settings that you change to Firefox itself, this project is configured to use a profile called "single-spa-inspector-dev". To create this profile, go to `about:profiles` in Firefox and create it. From then on, Firefox will use that profile and remember any changes you make (e.g. devtools location, devtools dark mode, etc.)
